<!-- this is a subheadline -->
As part of my Ph.D., I conduct research in the [Computational Design of Therapeutics Lab](https://macglab.icm.jhu.edu) at Johns Hopkins under the guidance of [Dr. Feilim Mac Gabhann](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/people/faculty/feilim-mac-gabhann/). I create computational models of immune signaling and cell growth in healthy and diseased uterine tissues. Additionally, I am an MIT alumna (B.S., Bioengineering, 2017) and National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow. <br /><br />
