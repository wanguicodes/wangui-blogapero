<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am a Biomedical Engineering PhD Candidate at Johns Hopkins that creates computational tools to help better better understand and treat uterine disorders. Under the mentorship of Dr. Feilim Mac Gabhann, I develop computational models of immune signaling and cell growth in endometriosis. Outside of lab, I mentor research projects at the Baltimore Underground Science Space, and create opportunities for community and development for underrepresented students in STEM at Johns Hopkins.
