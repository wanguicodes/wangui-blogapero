<!-- this is a subheadline -->
As part of my Ph.D., I conduct research in the [Computational Design of Therapeutics Lab](https://macglab.icm.jhu.edu) at Johns Hopkins with the mentorship of Dr. Feilim Mac Gabhann. I create computational models of immune signaling and cell growth in healthy and diseased uterine tissues. Additionally, I am an MIT alumna (B.S., Bioengineering, 2017) and National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow.  <br /><br />
